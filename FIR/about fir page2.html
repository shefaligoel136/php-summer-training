 organizations in countries when the police receives information about any criminal offence. It is generally a complaint lodged with the police by the victim of a cognizable
 offense or by someone on his or her behalf, but anyone can make such a report either orally or in writing to the police. Investigating work of the police starts after an FIR
 is recorded<br><br>

For a non-cognizable offense a community service register is created and registered.<br>

 investigation of the case. Anyone who knows about the commission of a cognizable offence, including police officers, can file an FIR<br><hr>
